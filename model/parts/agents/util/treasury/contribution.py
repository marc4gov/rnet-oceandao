# MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT: should try not to mix outcomes/deliverables and activities/processes, 
# should probably be split so you do not get a lot of reward for a 1000 tweets.

# HOMEWORK: Study Sourcred document from Marc in chat and consider dimensions the the below and their weights to reach
# consensus Monday.
